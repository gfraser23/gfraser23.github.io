  <h2> Biography </h2>
  <p> I lived at Boys and Girls Country for six years until I graduated from Waller High School in 2009. After a brief sabbatical I returned to thier College and Career Program in 2012. Coming back to Boys and Girls Country was the greatest decision of my life. I was welcomed back with open arms by their loving staff. After proving that I could follow all guidelines set before I was given the opportunity to attend college. I graduated from Stephen F State University in 2018 and started my career in the Mortgage business. A career that was only possible through an internship Boys and Girls Country found for me in 2015! I am extremely grateful for Boys and Girls Country, I would never be where I am today without all the loving staff, donors and friends I've met through this wonderful home for children </p>
