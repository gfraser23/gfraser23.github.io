  <h2> Bio </h2>
  <p> I lived at Boys and Girls Country for six years until I graduated from Waller High School in 2009. After a brief sabbatical I returned to thier College and Career Program in 2012. Coming back to Boys and Girls Country was the greatest decision of my life. I was welcomed back with open arms by their loving staff. After proving that I could follow all guidelines set before I was given the opportunity to attend college. I graduated from Stephen F State University in 2018 and started my career in the Mortgage business. </p>
